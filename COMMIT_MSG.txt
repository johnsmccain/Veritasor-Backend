test(integration): add auth API integration tests

Add comprehensive integration tests for authentication endpoints:
- User signup with validation
- User login with credential verification
- Token refresh flow
- Get current user (authenticated and unauthenticated)
- Forgot password flow
- Reset password flow with token validation
- Full auth flow integration tests

Tests use Jest and Supertest with mock auth router. Mock implementation
includes in-memory stores for users, tokens, and reset tokens. Tests
follow security best practices including no email enumeration and proper
token invalidation.

Test setup includes:
- Jest configuration with ts-jest for TypeScript support
- Test scripts in package.json (test, test:watch, test:coverage)
- Documentation in tests/README.md and tests/SETUP.md
- Updated .gitignore for coverage reports

Ready for actual auth router implementation - simply replace mock
router with real implementation when available.
